🌐 Understanding Kubernetes Services: Services in Kubernetes serve two primary purposes:
🔹 Load balancing across multiple pods.
🔹 Exposing pods to external traffic for connectivity.

📝 Pod Creation & YAML Configuration:
🔹 Kubernetes uses YAML files to define pod specifications.
🔹 The kubectl apply command is used to create pods.

🔍 Pod Connectivity:
🔹 Pods have internal connectivity but are isolated from external traffic.
🔹 Using kubectl exec, we can attach to a pod and inspect its IP address.

🔗 Service Types in Kubernetes:
🔹 Public Services (NodePort): Expose pods to external traffic.
🔹 Private Services (ClusterIP): Keep pods accessible only within the cluster.

🚀 Service Functionality & Load Balancing:
🔹 Services act as a gateway between external users and pods.
🔹 Kubernetes services use labels and selectors to automatically discover and connect to new pods.
🔹 Load balancing ensures even distribution of traffic across multiple pods.

📡 NodePort & External Access:
🔹 Services use NodePort to allow external access by assigning a port on the worker node.
🔹 The kube-proxy component routes requests between external clients and pods.
🔹 Services function as a reverse proxy, forwarding traffic to appropriate pods.

📌 Topics Covered:
✅ Pod Creation & YAML Configurations
✅ Service Types & Connectivity
✅ Load Balancing & Traffic Management
✅ NodePort & External Access
✅ Auto Discovery of New Pods

✨ Outcome:
🔹 Gained a deep understanding of Kubernetes services and their role in networking.
🔹 Learned how to expose pods externally and manage traffic flow.
🔹 Explored the role of kube-proxy and NodePort in service connectivity.
🔹 Understood the importance of labels and selectors in auto-discovery.
